Dear _[Name]_,

sorry that _you_ didn't _feel_ _up_ to _celebrating_ _Christmas_ this _year_ with the _family_.
We all _missed_ _you_ so very much.
_[Relative 1]_ had _cooked_ a tasty _lasagna_ that we all devoured like a _flock_ of starving raptors.
We lit a cosy _fire_
and layed a _puzzle_ of a bottlenosed dolphin.
I got a pair of socks from mom and dad,
and your brother a new tie.
Everyone was in a good mood until the cousins started talking politics,
without _you_ there no one had the energy to oppose them.
I hope _you_ feel better and that you'll come visit soon.

Love,

Sister
