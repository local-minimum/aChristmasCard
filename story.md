Letter
======

Dear _[Name]_,

_sorry_ that _you_ didn't _feel_ _up_ to _celebrating_ _Christmas_ this _year_ with the _family_.
We _all_ _missed_ _you_ so very much.
_[Relative]_ had baked a _tasty_ _pie_ that we _all_ _devoured_ _like_ a _pack_ of _starving_ _raptors_.
We _lit_ a _cosy_ _fire_
and _put_ _together_ a _jigsaw puzzle_ of some _ugly_ _castle_.
I got a _pair_ of _socks_ from our _parents_ and _your_ _brother_ got a _new_ _tie_.
Everyone was in a _great_ _mood_ until the cousins _started_ _talking_ _politics_... _missed_ _you_.
I _hope_ _you_ _feel_ better and that _you_'ll come _visit_ _soon_.

_Love_,
_[Brother/Sister]_
